Rollback analysis alogorithm

This is not a traditional blackjack program in that it does not simulate a blackjack dealer. Rather, it simulates a blackjack player. Utilising a roll back analysis algorithm, the game is able to play blackjack with perfect strategy. Utilising threading techniques, it is able to do so under normal casino time constraints. Now, if I can only smuggle my laptop into a casino... :)
